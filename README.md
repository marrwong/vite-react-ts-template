# React and TypeScript Template Built with Vite

[React](https://reactjs.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) template for frontend built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

## Aims of Project

To provide both new and experienced developers with a simple yet functional template for rapid prototyping, code linting and deployment to Netlify.

## Using this Template

### First Steps

Clone the repository with a fresh git log:

`npx degit marrwong/vite-react-ts-template <your project name>`

Navigate into the folder:

`cd <your project name>`

Install dependencies

`npm install`

Start dev server

`npm run dev`

### Commit the Newly Created Repo

Initialize a git repository in the newly cloned project:

`git init`

Stage the files for commit:

`git add .`

Commit the repo with commit message:

`git commit -m 'initial commit'`

Set the origin of the repo (for the `git push` command):

`git remote add origin <your git repo>`

Push to GitHub (main branch):

`git push --set-upstream origin main`

## Deployment on Netlify

The netlify.toml file is included to handle redirects so that the app can work on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
